This project includes the following:


1. Understand the Dataset

Before diving into operations, it's crucial to understand:

    Columns: What each represents (START_DATE, CATEGORY, etc.).
    Purpose: What kind of insights you want (e.g., mileage trends, trip categories).
    Questions: Examples include:
        What are the most common purposes for trips?
        Are there patterns in trip distance?
        What locations are frequently used for starting or stopping trips?

2. Data Cleaning

Operations for ensuring data quality:

    Check for Missing Data:
        PURPOSE has missing values (NaN in row 1). Decide how to handle them:
            Impute missing values (e.g., based on the most common purpose or leave as-is).
            Analyze separately (trips with and without a defined purpose).
    Ensure Data Consistency:
        Confirm that START_DATE and END_DATE are in proper datetime format.
        Verify that CATEGORY and PURPOSE are consistent (no typos, duplicates).
    Remove or Flag Duplicates:
        Check for duplicate rows (though it seems unique here).

3. Feature Engineering

Derive new columns for more granular insights:

    Trip Duration: Calculate trip time using END_DATE - START_DATE.
    Day of Week/Hour of Day: Extract these from START_DATE for temporal analysis.
        Example: Are most trips during weekdays or weekends?
    Trip Type: Create a binary flag for long vs. short trips (e.g., MILES > 10).

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Identify patterns and trends:

    Summary Statistics:
        Average, median, and max MILES for trips.
        Distribution of trips by CATEGORY and PURPOSE.
    Visualization:
        Bar Chart: Distribution of PURPOSE.
        Histogram: MILES to understand trip distance distribution.
        Heatmap: Frequency of trips by Day and Hour.
    Temporal Analysis:
        Analyze how mileage or trip counts vary over time (daily, monthly).

5. Hypothesis Testing

Apply statistical tests to answer questions:

    Are trips with a purpose longer than trips without a purpose? (t-test)
    Do trips to different locations have different average mileages? (ANOVA)

6. Insights & Patterns

Answer key business questions:

    High-Mileage Trips:
        What purposes or categories contribute to the longest trips?
    Common Purposes:
        What is the most frequent purpose for trips, and does it differ by category?

7. Data Modeling (Optional)

If needed for predictive analysis:

    Predict PURPOSE or CATEGORY based on MILES, START, and STOP.
    Cluster trips based on START, STOP, and MILES to find patterns.

8. Reporting

Summarize findings for stakeholders:

    Include visuals (charts/graphs).
    Highlight actionable insights (e.g., optimize routes, analyze customer visits).
