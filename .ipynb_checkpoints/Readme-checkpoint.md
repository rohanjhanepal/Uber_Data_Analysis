Recommendations

    Enhance Data Collection:

        Address missing PURPOSE data by updating the app interface to require purpose selection.

    Driver Scheduling:

        Allocate more drivers during peak hours (8 AM–6 PM) and on high-demand days (Fridays, Mondays and Tuesdays).

    Long-Trip Incentives:
